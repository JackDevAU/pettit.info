## Is this thing on?

This will be my first blog post on my own site! All together now, "Woo" üòÇ 

I can't say I'm a big blogger but I think its important to have a place to voice opinions on the internet that isn't Twitter. 

To the millions (or handful) of future strangers and friends stumbling onto this blog, **welcome!** 

A bit about me, I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer. I surround myself with React and .NET so if thats up your alley then this is the place for you! 

But enough about me‚Ä¶ Let's look to the **future**! 

I have an ever growing backlog of ideas that I want to write about so stay tuned for more amazing content from me. Or maybe "mildly interesting" is a better descriptor. We'll see.

### Future blogs - coming soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è:

* Getting started with Keystatic + Next.js 
* A shoutout to an amazing Next.js tool "Kirimase" 
* Getting started with TinaCMS + Next.js
* My favourite packages to use with React
* How I setup a project
