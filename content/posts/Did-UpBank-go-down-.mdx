Roughly 9 days ago, while i was trying to access my mobile banking app of choice. Some might say, the best banking app. It just wasn't loading?!

I posted on Discord, asked family and friends to check if its just a me issue…?!

But it wasn't just a me issue… within about 20minutes I see the first post up on Reddit about it. Then many more… But while Reddit is a good place to check these types of outages and express opinions. It's not always the most reliable place to go nor is it have a quick enough response time. 

So, I search for “up bank status”, but its just a plain website saying there is no outage at all?! 

While i was disappointed, this left an opening in the market, why don't i just make this myself. I had just make an api and budgeting app for Up (TODO: ADD LINKS HERE)

Why not add an uptime tracker as well… so i did just that. Introduce: [uptime.jackpettit.dev](https://uptime.jackpettit.dev/)

A way we can now actually see some stats over the past 90 days!
