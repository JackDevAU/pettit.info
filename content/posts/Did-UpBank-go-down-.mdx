Roughly 9 days ago i tried to open my mobile banking app of choice, Up. But, It just wasn’t loading?!

At first i’m thinking… ok, is this just a me issue? I posted on Discord, asked family and friends to check. Same thing.

So i search for “up bank status”… and it’s just this plain website saying there is no outage at all?! Meanwhile the app still isn’t loading.

Then i hit Reddit. Within about 20 minutes i see the first post about it. Then many more. So yeah, definitely not just me.

Now, Reddit is a great place to confirm these types of outages and read opinions, but it’s not always the most reliable place to go. It also doesn’t give you a quick, clear answer with actual numbers.

That was the moment i realised there’s a gap here. Why don’t i just build this myself?

I’d just made an API package ([@jackdevau/up-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jackdevau/up-api)) for typescript and a budgeting app for Up ([up.jackpettit.dev](https://up.jackpettit.dev)), so i thought… why not add an uptime tracker as well. So i did.

Introducing: [uptime.jackpettit.dev](https://uptime.jackpettit.dev)

It’s a simple way to see stats over the past 90 days:

* Service uptime
* Response time to the Cloudflare server
