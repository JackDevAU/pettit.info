## Project Overview

The Mortgage Mum is a bespoke marketing website built for a family friend working as a mortgage broker. The site is designed around reusable blocks and templates powered by TinaCMS, making it easy to spin up new pages, campaigns, and content without developer involvement.

You can visit the live site at [themortgagemum.com.au](https://www.themortgagemum.com.au/).

## Technical Highlights

- **TinaCMS-driven content modelling:** Pages are built using flexible blocks and templates defined in TinaCMS, allowing editors to compose rich content layouts.
- **Custom form logic:** Lead capture forms are powered by a dedicated TinaCMS collection, enabling editors to configure fields and routing without touching code.
- **Email and spam protection:** Form submissions integrate with Resend for email delivery and use Google reCAPTCHA to help prevent spam.
- **SEO scoring component:** A custom SEO component analyses each page’s title, description, tags, and Open Graph image to generate a score out of 100, giving editors immediate feedback on their on-page SEO.

## Outcome

The result is a performant, easy-to-manage marketing site where non-technical stakeholders can confidently create and optimise pages while keeping technical implementation details hidden behind a friendly CMS experience.
