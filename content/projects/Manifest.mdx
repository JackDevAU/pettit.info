## Project Overview

Manifest is an advanced developer tool designed to bridge the gap between AI assistance and traditional software engineering workflows. Built as an Electron application using the OpenCode SDK, it leverages Git worktrees to provide a seamless environment for code review, documentation lookup, and isolated testing.

The primary goal of Manifest is to empower developers to review AI-generated code and Pull Requests with greater confidence and efficiency. By integrating directly with Git and GitHub, it allows users to spin up self-contained Docker environments for testing changes in isolation, ensuring that bugs are caught early and software quality remains high.

## Key Features

* **AI-Powered Code Review:** Utilize multiple AI models to analyze changes, explain complex logic, and answer questions about specific diffs before consulting the original author.
* **Git Worktree Integration:** seamlessly switch between branches and contexts without disrupting your main working directory.
* **Isolated Testing Environments:** Automatically provision Docker containers to test changes safely and independently.
* **Custom Agent Workflows:** Write and execute custom AI agents to automate repetitive tasks and accelerate development.
* **Faster Feedback Loops:** reduce the time between code writing and review by getting immediate, context-aware feedback from AI.
