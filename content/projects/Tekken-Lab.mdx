**Project Overview**

Tekken Lab is a website designed to streamline the learning process for Tekken 8 combos by allowing users to watch YouTube guides and practice combos in a single, unified platform. Later I started to introduce guides and patch notes for the community. 

**Motivation**

I created Tekken Lab over a weekend due to the lack of suitable solutions available at the time. Although still in beta, this project showcases my ability to identify a need and rapidly develop a functional solution.

**Technical Highlights**

* **First production use of Keystatic:** Tekken Lab marked my first experience using Keystatic in a real-world project. This allowed me to explore Keystatic's capabilities and limitations, ultimately contributing to its further development.
