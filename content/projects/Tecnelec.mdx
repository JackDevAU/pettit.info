## Project Overview

Tecnelec is a marketing site built for a family member’s electrical business. It focuses on clarity and ease of maintenance rather than heavy custom functionality, while still giving full control over content via TinaCMS.

You can visit the live site at [tecnelec.com.au](https://tecnelec.com.au/).

## Technical Highlights

- **TinaCMS content editing:** All key pages and sections are editable through TinaCMS, allowing quick updates to services, copy, and contact information.
- **Next.js foundation:** Built on Next.js for fast, SEO-friendly pages with a straightforward deployment pipeline.
- **Form handling and protection:** Contact forms integrate with Resend for email delivery and Google reCAPTCHA for basic spam protection.

## Outcome

The project delivers a clean, professional online presence that is easy for non-technical users to keep up-to-date without sacrificing performance or flexibility.
